A Peer-to-Peer Secure File Transfer (LAN-Only)

**Overview:**
BridgeX is a secure file transfer desktop web app designed for devices connected to the same **local network (LAN)**.
The backend (already implemented in Python + Flask) handles authentication, TCP socket connections, UDP broadcasts for discovery, AES encryption for file transfer, and storing active sockets for reuse.

This frontend should be built **purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks), fully integrated with the backend’s REST API.
The layout should be **centered** with a fixed maximum width so it does **not** cover the entire screen on desktop.
It must be responsive for smaller devices.

## **Frontend Requirements**

### 1. **Login & Registration Page**

* **Fields:** Username, Password.
* **Buttons:** "Log In", "Register".
* Uses:

  * `POST /login` ? `{ username, password }`
  * `POST /register` ? `{ username, password }`
* Display backend response messages (success/error) without page reload.
* After login, redirect to dashboard.

### 2. **Dashboard (Main Page)**

#### **Connection Controls**

* **Connect button:** Calls `POST /connect` to start TCP listener and UDP broadcasting.

  * Changes to **Disconnect** when connected (calls `POST /disconnect`).
* **Accept button:** Calls `GET /active_users` to list available users on LAN.

  * Show dropdown or list of usernames.
  * Each username has a **Pair** button ? calls `POST /pair/<username>` to connect.

#### **File Sending**

* Section with:

  * File picker (allow multiple file selection).
  * **Send** button ? sends files sequentially to the paired device via `POST /send` (multipart/form-data).
  * Progress indicator and status updates.

#### **Received Files**

* Section showing a list/table of received files (from `GET /received_files`).

  * Each row: filename, size, sender, download link.
  * Update in real time or via refresh button.

## **Backend API (For JavaScript Integration)**

| Endpoint           | Method | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/register`        | POST   | Register new user (JSON body: `{username, password}`) |
| `/login`           | POST   | Log in user (JSON body: `{username, password}`)       |
| `/connect`         | POST   | Start TCP listener & UDP broadcast                    |
| `/disconnect`      | POST   | Stop connection, close socket                         |
| `/active_users`    | GET    | Get list of available users on LAN                    |
| `/pair/<username>` | POST   | Pair with a selected user                             |
| `/send`            | POST   | Send one or multiple files (multipart/form-data)      |
| `/received_files`  | GET    | Get list of received files                            |

**All responses are JSON** and contain at least `{ "status": "success" | "error", "message": "<text>" }` plus additional data if needed.

## **UI & Styling**

* Centered content container, **max-width: 900px**, padding all around.
* Light theme with clean fonts and soft shadows.
* Navigation bar at top with app name **"BridgeX"** and a logout button.
* Buttons styled with rounded corners, hover effect, and consistent colors.
* File send progress bar below send button.
* Notification area for showing success/error messages.

---

## **Additional Notes**

* **No full-page reloads** — all interactions should be AJAX-based (`fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`).
* Keep styles responsive but **never stretch to full device width** on desktop.
* Make sure JavaScript handles both success and error states from backend properly.
* Allow multiple files to be sent in sequence, not all at once.
* Keep design minimal but modern.
create a logo as well that aligns with connectivity and security
